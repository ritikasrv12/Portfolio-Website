# Portfolio-Website
 This is my portfolio website where I showcase my skills and experience as a front-end developer. I created this website to demonstrate my ability to create responsive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing websites using HTML and CSS. My website features a homepage, an About page, and a contact page.
 
 -> On my homepage: I introduce myself and tell the visitors who I am, what I do, and where I come from. I also include a photo of myself and a catchy slogan that reflects my personality and passion for web development.
 -> On my About page: I provide more details about my skills, experience, and education in web development. I list the technologies and tools that I use, the projects that I have worked on or contributed to, and the certificates or awards that I have earned.
  -> On my contact page: I invite visitors to get in touch with me if they are interested in hiring me or collaborating with me on web development projects. I provide my email address, phone number, social media links, and a contact form.
  
  If you like what you see, feel free to contact me anytime. I would love to hear from you and discuss your next project. 😊
